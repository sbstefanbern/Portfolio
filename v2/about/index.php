          <p>I live in an apartment a few kilometers out from Odense C. Denmakrs 3rd biggets city located on the island of Funen in the middle of Denmark. As hobbies I love watching football, going to bars and pubs in the city with my friends. But my biggest hobby is what I study towards. Being creative and creating things. Editing videos, creating interfaces, and thing for people to interact with. This is what I spend a big time of my freetime doing. Fo rme it is very important to work with something that you love doing and something which is not seen as ‘work’ but something that you truly enjoy doing.
