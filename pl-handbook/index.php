          <h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>
          <p>Handbook with key information and statistics about the Premier League. Each of the 20 teams have their own full themed pages after the clubs colors, containing a wide variety of information about them, their history, their best players throughout history, and their trophy haul. The book is made with the generally minimalistic Premier League visual identity in mind, showing throughout with the shapes and graphics, the use of the "swoosh" and the colors of the cover and non-specific club pages. This book was made as the typography final exam in my Graphic Design education. It was not used outside this setting.</p>
