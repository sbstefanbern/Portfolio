          <h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>
          <p>A large portion of Ekstra Bladet's readers are sports interested. For that reason it is important for them to have a large coverage of the most popular sport in Denmark, Football, including the transfer windows where clubs can sell and buy players. My task was to create a visual identity that they could use leading up to, and on the last day of the transfer window. This woul play an important part of their large coverage of this and includes material to be used on the website, graphics used in the TV Studio, and advertising leading up to the event.</p>
