          <h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>
          <p>Fri Bike Shop has cycling shops located all throughout Denmark. They needed roll up banners for the entrance in their shop in Odense and because of that got in contact with me. At their request it should be a minimal design with focus on saving money. With that in mind, I started my work and came up with two different variations, of which both was used.</p>
